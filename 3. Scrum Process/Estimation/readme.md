## The Point Scale

We currently use [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com)'s linear point system.
We’ve found that the scale is easy to explain and easy for developers to get good at using. It also ensures that points reflect effort instead of time estimates.

### 1 Point
> I understand exactly what needs to be done, and exactly how to do it.
 
### 2 Points
> I understand exactly what needs to be done, but I’m going to have to do a little bit of thinking or experimentation to figure out how to do it.
 
### 3 Points
> I mostly understand what needs to be done, but there is enough uncertainty here that requires breaking this story futher.

### General Estimation Guidelines
- Estimates should reflect level of **effort**, NOT time.
- In any given iteration, developers should *only* work on 1 or 2 point stories
- For Tech Leads breaking down tasks, consider how complex they are to the developers, not for yourself.
