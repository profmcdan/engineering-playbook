## `zsh` Setup

`zsh` (Z shell) is an extended `bash` with a large number of improvements. We recommend using this for a delightful experience with the terminal.

We recomend using [OhMyZsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) as a framework for managing your `zsh` configurations. Follow [setup instructions here](hhttps://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh#getting-started).

Among other advantages, OhMyZsh comes with an extended list of `git aliases` that come in handy during your development. See a [complete list here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Cheatsheet#git).
